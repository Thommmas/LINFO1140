## Abstract

This synthesis serves as a reflection on LINFO1140 taken during the second semester of the 2022-2023 academic year. Taught by Olivier Bonaventure, this course marked the inaugural offering, providing a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental principles of digital devices and computer operation. As the author writes this synthesis in May 2023, amidst the anticipation of upcoming exams, the atmosphere is bathed in sunlight, enhancing the sense of reflection and the culmination of a transformative learning experience.

## Introduction

Computers play an increasingly central role in our society, which is becoming more and more digital. This course aims to teach you the basic principles of how the digital devices you use every day operate. The course is based on the excellent book "The Elements of Computing Systems" written by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken, published by MIT Press.

While the syllabus is not exhaustive, the reference book contains many details that are not covered here. However, the syllabus is interactive, meaning that alongside the theoretical concepts, you will also find numerous exercises supported by Ingenious to allow each student to assess their understanding of the theory.

In this course, we will cover various aspects of computer operation. In any computer, information is encoded in the form of bits. Each bit can have two distinct values: 0 and 1. The main advantage of bits is that it is possible to represent any type of data (numbers, characters, text, images, videos, sounds, etc.) as a sequence of bits. We will focus on Boolean logic, which allows us to manipulate these bits. The early computers were designed to perform numerical calculations. We will then explore how to represent numbers in binary form and how to construct circuits that enable addition, subtraction, and other operations on integers. We will also analyze how a computer can store information and utilize the stored information in memory.

At this stage, we will have learned the foundations that enable us to design a simple microprocessor that can be programmed. We will start by building a machine language that allows us to program this microprocessor. Using a simulator, we will be able to test small programs on our future microprocessor before actually constructing it. We will then focus on computer architecture and the interactions between the microprocessor, memory, and input/output. After building this microprocessor, you will learn how to define an assembly language that is easier for programmers to use than machine language. The course will conclude with an explanation of how data storage devices work.
